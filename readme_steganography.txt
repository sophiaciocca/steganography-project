    Yes!



/**********************************************************************

 **********************************************************************/

    Now, we can access them in whatever program we want! These are
    useful functions that could be used in lots of different ways.
    
    Additionally, if this was all one file, it'd be so hard to edit/debug/etc! 
    This is nice and digestible and portable and awesome. 
    
    Also now anyone can use them if they have the file!

/**********************************************************************

    --4 or 5 TAs in Office Hours (sorry, I don't remember all of their names!)
    --Christian Barcenas a bit at the beginning
    --checked some things (including Encrypt) with Hunter 
      (a fellow student) during office hours
    --Mike Patterson was SUPER HELPFUL AND AWESOME when he randomly
           showed up during office hours

Yes! I did the first extra credit option. I hope you enjoy messages of 
love and happiness yay

   ...I was in office hours today (Monday) for six hours, and for parts of it
   there was only ONE TA on duty and probably 30 names on the board. It was
   absurd and awful. Please maybe alter the staffing model? :/
                                  
  Also, people routinely misunderstand the flow of names, and put their
  names in the wrong place on the list during Office Hours. Mike came up
  with a good suggestion - perhaps try using a Google form instead that
  everyone can submit when they need help during OH, and then you'll have
  a timestamp. Otherwise it gets pretty unfair - names in wrong places,
  TAs ignoring certain lists by accident ... I just think there might be
  ways to solve these issues that are frustrating for students and TAs alike.
